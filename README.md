Developed a hands-free navigation solution incorporating gesture recognition and voice control technologies for applications in Healthcare, Gaming, Entertainment, and more.
The Virtual Mouse module of GestureWorks utilizes hand gesture recognition to interpret specific hand movements as input and control computer mouse activities accordingly.
The implementation is based on Python and relies on libraries such as OpenCV and Mediapipe [the CNN Model] for image processing and gesture detection.
